### Documentation source

This folder contains `jiant`'s documentation source code. The `jiant` project uses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), CircleCI, and GitHub pages to build, deploy, and host these docs. `jiants`'s latest published documentation is hosted [here](https://pyeres.github.io/jiant/).

##### [Optional] Build from source and view documentation locally:
1. run `make clean html` in this directory.
2. open `jiant/docs/_build/html/index.html` in your browser.
